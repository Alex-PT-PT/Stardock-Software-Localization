# Stardock-Software-Localization

## Mission
A public effort to improve Stardock language localizations for software product catalog.

## Usage
Anyone familiar with how GitHub works knows how to use the common tools for forking a repository, making edits, and submitting pull requests for us to include them in the main. For anyone with this knowledge, they can skip to the [Format](README.md#format) section to see how the language files are structured for each product. 

The following directions are more for the laymen who wants to contribute but does not want the complication of installing related software.
