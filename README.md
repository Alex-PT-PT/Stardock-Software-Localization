# Stardock-Software-Localization

## Mission
A public effort to improve Stardock language localizations for software product catalog.

## Usage
Anyone familiar with how GitHub works knows how to use the common tools for forking a repository, making edits, and submitting pull requests for us to include them in the main. For anyone with this knowledge, they can skip to the [Format](README.md#format) section to see how the language files are structured for each product. 

The following directions are more for the laymen who wants to contribute but does not want the complication of installing related software.
### Creating a GitHub account
The one thing you will need is a free [GitHub acount](https://github.com/join). 

### Editing a language file
In this example, we will:
 - Initiate editing an exsiting DeskScapes language file
 - Creating a fork \ branch to edit it under your credentials
 - Creating a 'pull request' to have it reviewed and included in the main repository

Click on the DeskScapes\DeskScapes 11 folder
