# Stardock-Software-Localization

[Mission](main/README.md#Mission)

## Mission
A public effort to improve Stardock language localizations for software product catalog.

## Supported Languages
Stardock Software officially supports and maintains the following languages:
-   German
-   Spanish
-   French
-   Korean
-   Russian
-   Portuguese - Brazil
-   Chinese (Simplified)
-   Chinese (Traditional)
- 
We will accept any other user-created languages, and include them in the products, but we will not officially maintain them.  Any updates for the non-supported languages will have to come from the community via this project.

## Editing and Submitting Languages
Anyone familiar with how GitHub works knows how to use the common tools for forking a repository, making edits, and submitting pull requests for us to include them in the main. For anyone with this knowledge, they can skip to the [Format](README.md#format) section to see how the language files are structured for each product. 

The following directions are more for the laymen who wants to contribute but does not want the complication of installing related software.
### Creating a GitHub account
The one thing you will need is a free [GitHub acount](https://github.com/join). 

### Editing a language file
In this example, we will:
 - Initiate editing an exsiting DeskScapes language file
 - Creating a fork \ branch to edit it under your credentials
 - Creating a 'pull request' to have it reviewed and included in the main repository

Click on the DeskScapes\DeskScapes 11 folder

Click the pencil 
![enter image description here](https://cdn.stardock.us/support/uploads/Teams_2023-10-02_13-24-45sdrohan.png)

You will be notifed that to edit the file, it needs to be 'forked' to contine.  Forking any file is just an act to create a copy under your own account.
![enter image description here](https://cdn.stardock.us/support/uploads/Teams_2023-10-02_13-28-54sdrohan.png)

You can now freely edit the the file under your own forked copy.  Once done, click the green 'commit changes' button
![enter image description here](https://cdn.stardock.us/support/uploads/Teams_2023-10-02_13-30-20sdrohan.png)

In the commit popup, add some details about what you changed and why (poorly phrased, inaccurate word choices, etc). Click 'propose changes' once done:
![enter image description here](https://cdn.stardock.us/support/uploads/Teams_2023-10-02_13-32-02sdrohan.png)

After you have edited one or more files, create a 'Pull request' (you are asking us to 'pull' your changes from your fork with this act)
![enter image description here](https://cdn.stardock.us/support/uploads/Teams_2023-10-02_13-34-18sdrohan.png)

Like you did for the individual files, you can write more details about any changed you made
![enter image description here](https://cdn.stardock.us/support/uploads/Teams_2023-10-02_13-36-21sdrohan.png)

Once complete, we are notified here. Once reviewed, we will communicate withy you (via GitHub and its email notify system) if we have any questions and either accept or deny the pull. 

If accepted, you will be credited in the changelog for any application release.
