# Start11 v2 Language Localizations
## File Format
For details on how the files are formatted, please see:
https://github.com/StardockCorp/Stardock-Software-Localization#language-file-format-and-testing

As noted there, the en.lng file is the root of all others.  It is currently formatted where all Start11 v1 strings are at the top half of the file and the version 2 strings below the

> ;Start11v2

Separator (line 477).

All other languages provided have been organized in the same fashion. 

It goes without saying that the top half, which has been reviewed many times by many contributors during the life of Start11 v1, will be the most accurate.  However, like with the new v2 stings, the fit in the UI will have to be ensured again. 

## Lauguages
The Stardock officially supported languages are:
-   German (de)
-   Spanish (sp)
-   French (fr)
-   Korean (ko)
-   Russian (ru)
-   Portuguese - Brazil (pt-br)
-   Chinese (Simplified) (zh-cn)
-   Chinese (Traditional) (zh-tw)

That said, there are other languages that have been included that have been submitted and maintained by the community.  While they will be included in future releases, they will not be 'officially supported'.
